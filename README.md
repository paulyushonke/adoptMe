# Welcome to our "Adopt Me" web application 🐾🏡
  This project is a result of our dedicated work during the FrontendMaster [React course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v8/), where I learned and implemented the fundamentals of React to create a seamless and engaging user experience. 
  
  Our application aims to simplify the pet adoption process, making it easier for users to find their perfect furry companions
